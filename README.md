## Contribute

### Add a new library
To add a new library, consult the Nx documentation:
https://nx.dev/packages/js/generators/library#@nx/js:library

When adding a playground for your lib, also make sure the project has at least one test or provide a placeholder.

### Publish

The libraries in this project can be published to the npm registry. To do so follow these steps:

1. In the library that you want to publish, bump the version in package & package-lock files.
2. Commit the changes using the following convention: `build(<library>): v1.0.0`.
3. Add a tag using the following convention: `@studiohyperdrive/<library>@v1.0.0`.
4. Make a new production build of your library using `npm run build:<library>`.
5. Move to the dist folder of your library using `cd dist/<library>`
6. Publish the package using `npm publish`  
   a. If this is the first time publishing the library make sure to add the `--access public` flag.  
   b. Make sure you are logged into npm and that you have been added to the @studiohyperdrive organisation.
